# Sliced Bread 

An image processing tool for data augmentation and affine transforms built using OpenCV, GDAL, tifffile, NumPy, Python

## Functionalities
### 1) Grayscale Conversion
Converts image into grayscale using OpenCV
### 2)Image Rotation
Rotates image by order of 90 degrees
### 3) Image Resize
Downscale or Upscale an image
### 3) Vertical and Horizotal Flip
Mirrors the image along the x-axis or y-axis or both
### 4) Channel Stacking and Tensor
Create multi-channel images or image tensors. Can be used for channel separation and channel reordering as well.
### 5) Patches Processing
Create custom image patches(tiles) to train and test Convolutional Neural Networks. Recombine patches and integrate patches with lossless conversion.
